IT Expenditure Analysis
IT Expenditure Performance Story — Presentation Script

Slide 1: Introduction
“Today, I will walk you through our IT Expenditure Performance dashboards, which help us evaluate how effectively we are managing our IT spending across business areas, regions, and time periods. The goal is to compare Actual vs Forecast vs Plan and identify where performance is on track and where corrective actions are needed.”

📊 Story Part 1 — Overview of Financial Performance

“Starting with the first dashboard (top-left), we get a clear financial summary.

Our Total Actual IT Spend stands at $6.04M,

Total Forecast at $7.73M,

And Total Plan also at $7.73M.

This immediately highlights a spending shortfall:

We are $1.69M below both the Forecast and the Plan.

In percentage terms, this is a 21.87% underspend.

While underspending may appear positive, it can also signal delays in project execution, postponed initiatives, or underutilization of IT resources. This is an important point for management follow-up.”

📉 Story Part 2 — Business Area Performance Insights

“When we dig deeper into business areas, the bar chart shows us how each area performed:

Some areas such as Infrastructure and Office & Administrative functions report significantly lower actuals compared to forecast and planned values.

The BU and Manufacturing segments show more moderate gaps, though still below expectations.

This distribution tells us that the underspend isn’t uniform; it is driven primarily by specific departments, suggesting targeted interventions rather than organization-wide adjustments.”

🌍 Story Part 3 — Country/Region Contribution

“The donut chart shows that spending is predominantly concentrated in a single region—Latin America.
This heavy concentration means that any changes—positive or negative—within this region strongly influence total global IT performance.
Understanding local delays, vendor constraints, or project hold-ups will be key to interpreting the variance.”

📈 Story Part 4 — Monthly Trend Analysis

“In the monthly trend line, we see fluctuations over time.
Actual spending stays consistently below both the forecast and the plan across almost all months.
This pattern indicates that the variance is not due to a one-time event, but rather a persistent execution issue throughout the year.
It may point to delays in procurement, slower project startups, or efficiency improvements.”

📘 Story Part 5 — Comparison With the Second Dashboard (bottom-right)

“Now shifting to the second dashboard, which presents a similar analysis but on a larger scale:

Total Actual: 866M

Total Forecast: 891M

Total Plan: 900M

Here again, we see a gap:

There is a $24M variance between Actual and Forecast,

And a $34M variance compared to Plan.

The percentage variances follow the same pattern as the smaller dashboard: a consistent underspend.

The table further breaks down each business area, revealing that several functions—Services, Distribution, HR, Manufacturing—are contributing to the negative variance.
This allows leadership to identify exact cost centers where spending is falling short.”

📉 Trend & Variance Story

“The bar chart reinforces the comparison across Actual, Plan, and Forecast for each business area—visually confirming where gaps are largest.
The monthly trend chart at the bottom again mirrors the same behavior:
Actuals remain lower than both Forecast and Plan, suggesting a recurring operational pattern.”

📌 Final Story — What This Means for the Organization

“Across both dashboards, the message is consistent:

IT is consistently underspending, month after month.

The underspend is not uniform—specific business areas are strongly driving it.

Execution/implementation delays appear to be the main cause rather than cost savings.

Regional concentration shows that a single region heavily influences overall IT performance.

Forecasting accuracy may need improvement, given the repeated gap between expected and actual spend.

The overall takeaway is that while costs are controlled, project deployment and IT utilization need to be closely re-evaluated to ensure we are not delaying key initiatives that support business growth.”
